      changes made to marcel's game (breathtaking Flatverse)

set gome control values

initial hero size was 20
hero size was 20
min hero size was 20
max hero size was 100
init. hero speed was 80
hero shrink factor was 0.95 (or something like that)
hero grow factoe was 1.1
hero speed factor was 20

1. something happened that whenever something is bigger than me, I pass though it
2. init. hero size changes how fast you move, but not your start size. i can use this to see the effects of probblem 1 over time.
for some reason, when I set the  init. hero size  to 200, the balls get really big before the error, but with 300 or anything bigger the game freeses WAY earlier

3. when you grow, the speed does not update itself until you click and turn the ball
